To-Do:
    - add column lengths to string fields in model classes: Column(String(x))
    - specify nullable attributes on model class fields: Column(type, nullable=bool)
    - handle sessions at an endpoint level, i.e. per request; methods that query
      or manipulate data directly in the database should not also handle the lifecycle
      of a session (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_basics.html)*
    - handle circular imports in Flask configuration (app.py, routes.py)
    - update project directory structure to meet Flask documentation recommendations

Application Design:
    - in order of implementation level:
      1. config (flat-file): defines application config info (db connection info/credentials + Flask config)
      2. Config (class): parses and makes application config info accessible to application  
      3. DbContext (class): defines db connection string and handles db sessions
      4. <model_name> (class): defines a model class for use by SQLAlchemy ORM
      5. <controller_name> (<controller_name>.py): defines application endpoints (APIs)
      6. web server (app.py): exposes endpoints defined in controller files

Notes:
    - Student X is a high school upperclassman
    - 3 Questions for Student X:
      - what do former students like Student X do for a living?
      - what do former student like Student X have a college degree in?
      - for former students like Student X, is occupation outcome correlated with GPA?
    
    - Student Snapshot:
      - class rank (based on GPA)
      - historical rank (based on GPA)
      - career fit (career_1: %, career_2: %, career_3: %)
      - strongest subject (max gpa by subject)
      - weakest subject (min gpa by subject)
    
    - School Snapshot:
      - historical class ranking:
        - average median-salary by graduating class
        - average gpa by graduating class
      - most common occupation (occupation_1: %, occupation_2: %, occupation_3: %)
      - historical gpa analysis (mean|median|mode for all recorded students)
